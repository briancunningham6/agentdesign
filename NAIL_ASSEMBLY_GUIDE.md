# Nespresso Capsule Scraper - Metal Nail Assembly Guide

## Overview

The capsule scraper on the underside of the lid now uses **metal nail inserts** instead of 3D-printed plastic pins. This provides much better strength and durability when piercing the aluminum foil on Nespresso capsules.

## Required Materials

### Nails (choose one type):
1. **1.5mm Brad Nails** (recommended)
   - Diameter: 1.5mm
   - Length: 25-30mm
   - Commonly available at hardware stores
   - Example: 18ga x 1" (25mm) brad nails

2. **18ga Finish Nails** (alternative)
   - Diameter: ~1.25-1.5mm
   - Length: 25-30mm
   - Slightly thinner, still works well

### Tools:
- Small hammer or rubber mallet
- Needle-nose pliers (optional, for adjustments)
- Cutting pliers or nail clippers (if nails need trimming)

## Assembly Instructions

### Step 1: Prepare the Scraper
1. Print the lid (lid.stl) which includes the integrated scraper on the underside
2. Ensure the print is clean - remove any stringing or support material from the nail holes
3. Identify the 8 nail holes on the scraper base (they have countersunk sockets)

### Step 2: Insert Nails
1. **Orientation**: Place the lid upside-down on a soft surface (towel/cloth)
2. **Insert nails from the TOP** (socket side):
   - The nail head should sit in the countersunk socket
   - The nail shaft should pass through the tight friction-fit hole
   - The nail point will extend downward from the scraper base

3. **Press-fit method**:
   - Hold nail vertically above the hole
   - Press firmly with thumb to start the nail into the socket
   - Use gentle taps with a small hammer to drive nail deeper
   - Stop when nail head is flush with or slightly below the socket surface

4. **Tight fit is intentional**:
   - The hole diameter (1.4mm) is slightly smaller than the nail (1.5mm)
   - This creates a friction fit that holds the nail securely
   - If nail is too tight, you can pre-drill with a 1.4mm bit
   - If nail is too loose, try a slightly thicker nail or add a tiny drop of superglue

### Step 3: Adjust Nail Length (if needed)
1. **Check protrusion**: Nails should extend about 25-30mm below the scraper base
2. **Trim if necessary**:
   - Use cutting pliers or nail clippers
   - Cut from the point end (not the head)
   - Leave enough length to pierce the capsule foil and reach the grounds

### Step 4: Verify Installation
1. **Check all nails are secure**:
   - Gently tug on each nail - it should not pull out
   - Nail heads should be flush or slightly recessed in sockets
   - All nails should extend approximately the same length

2. **Test the scraper**:
   - The nail points should be evenly distributed
   - Pattern should provide good coverage across the capsule diameter

## Usage

### Piercing the Capsule:
1. Remove used Nespresso capsule from machine
2. Center capsule on the scraper (foil side up)
3. Press down firmly - nails will pierce the aluminum foil
4. Rotate capsule 1-2 full turns while pressing
5. Lift capsule and shake/tap to release grounds

### Maintenance:
- Rinse scraper after use to remove coffee residue
- Check nails periodically - they should remain firmly seated
- Replace any loose or bent nails

## Troubleshooting

**Nail won't fit in hole:**
- Verify you're using 1.5mm diameter nails (or smaller)
- Pre-drill hole with 1.4mm bit if needed
- Try a different nail (some may have slightly larger heads/shafts)

**Nail pulls out easily:**
- Use slightly thicker nails (1.6mm)
- Add a tiny drop of superglue to the nail shaft before insertion
- Check that the hole printed correctly (should be 1.4mm)

**Nails bend when piercing foil:**
- Use shorter nails (25mm instead of 30mm)
- Ensure nails are steel/metal, not soft aluminum
- Press straight down, don't twist before piercing

**Nail heads stick up above surface:**
- Tap nails deeper with hammer
- Verify socket depth is sufficient (8mm)
- File/sand nail head if it's too large for socket

## Technical Specifications

**Hole Design:**
- Socket diameter: 3.5mm (captures nail head)
- Socket depth: 8mm (countersink for head)
- Shaft hole diameter: 1.4mm (friction fit for 1.5mm nail)
- Reinforcement thickness: 10mm (strong base)
- Taper: 2mm transition from socket to shaft hole

**Recommended Nails:**
- Diameter: 1.5mm (18ga)
- Length: 25-30mm
- Material: Steel (not aluminum)
- Type: Brad nails or finish nails

## Why Metal Nails?

**Advantages over plastic pins:**
- ✓ Much stronger - won't bend or break
- ✓ Sharp points easily pierce aluminum foil
- ✓ Long-lasting and durable
- ✓ Inexpensive and readily available
- ✓ Easy to replace if damaged

**Design features:**
- Countersunk sockets capture nail heads
- Tight friction fit (0.1mm interference) holds nails securely
- 10mm reinforcement base provides strength
- Tapered transition guides nails into tight shaft hole
- Semi-random pattern ensures good capsule coverage
